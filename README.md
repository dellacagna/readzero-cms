# Payload Blank Template

This template comes configured with the bare minimum to get started on anything you need.

## Quick start

This template can be deployed directly from our Cloud hosting and it will setup MongoDB and cloud S3 object storage for media.

## Quick Start - local setup

To spin up this template locally, follow these steps:

### Clone

After you click the `Deploy` button above, you'll want to have standalone copy of this repo on your machine. If you've already cloned this repo, skip to [Development](#development).

### Development

1. First [clone the repo](#clone) if you have not done so already
2. `cd my-project && cp .env.example .env` to copy the example environment variables. You'll need to add the `MONGODB_URI` from your Cloud project to your `.env` if you want to use S3 storage and the MongoDB database that was created for you.

3. `pnpm install && pnpm dev` to install dependencies and start the dev server
4. open `http://localhost:3000` to open the app in your browser

That's it! Changes made in `./src` will be reflected in your app. Follow the on-screen instructions to login and create your first admin user. Then check out [Production](#production) once you're ready to build and serve your app, and [Deployment](#deployment) when you're ready to go live.

#### Docker (Optional)

If you prefer to use Docker for local development instead of a local MongoDB instance, the provided docker-compose.yml file can be used.

To do so, follow these steps:

- Modify the `MONGODB_URI` in your `.env` file to `mongodb://127.0.0.1/<dbname>`
- Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file's `MONGODB_URI` to match the above `<dbname>`
- Run `docker-compose up` to start the database, optionally pass `-d` to run in the background.

## How it works

The Payload config is tailored specifically to the needs of most websites. It is pre-configured in the following ways:

### Collections

See the [Collections](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/collections) docs for details on how to extend this functionality.

- #### Users (Authentication)

  Users are auth-enabled collections that have access to the admin panel.

  For additional help, see the official [Auth Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/auth) or the [Authentication](https://payloadcms.com/docs/authentication/overview#authentication-overview) docs.

- #### Media

  This is the uploads enabled collection. It features pre-configured sizes, focal point and manual resizing to help you manage your pictures.

### Docker

Alternatively, you can use [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to spin up this template locally. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Follow [steps 1 and 2 from above](#development), the docker-compose file will automatically use the `.env` file in your project root
1. Next run `docker-compose up`
1. Follow [steps 4 and 5 from above](#development) to login and create your first admin user

That's it! The Docker instance will help you get up and running quickly while also standardizing the development environment across your teams.

## Get the current user with an API Key

This project enables API keys for the Users collection and configures Arcs and Chapters to accept API-key-authenticated requests.

To fetch the current user associated with an API key, call the built-in endpoint:

- URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/users/me`
- Method: `GET`
- Auth header: `Authorization: API-Key <YOUR_USER_API_KEY>`

Example using curl:

```
curl -X GET \
  http://localhost:3000/api/users/me \
  -H "Authorization: API-Key YOUR_USER_API_KEY"
```

If the API key is valid, the response will include the current user document for that key.

Notes:
- Create or copy a User API Key from the Admin UI: Users -> choose a user -> API Keys.
- The same endpoint also works with a logged-in session or a JWT (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`), but for machine-to-machine calls use the API Key header shown above.
- With this setup, you can also create/update Arcs and Chapters by including the same `Authorization: API-Key <key>` header in your requests.
